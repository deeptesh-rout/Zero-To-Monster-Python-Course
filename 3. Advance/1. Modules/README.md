# Module?

### A module is a file containing Python code. This code can define functions, classes, and variables. Modules help organize related code into files that can be easily reused and imported into other Python scripts.

### Python's standard library is a collection of modules that provide ready-to-use functionality for tasks like file I/O, networking, and more.

```py
# Complete Module
import module_name

# Import as alias
import module_name as alias_name

# Specific Item
from module_name import item_name

# Import Specific item from a module and provide alias to that
from module_name import item_name as alias_name

# All Items
from module_name import *
```
