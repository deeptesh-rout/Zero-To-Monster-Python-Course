# Encapsulation?

#### Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components and only exposing what is necessary.

## Purpose

#### The primary purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal state and implementation details of an object and to provide a controlled interface for interacting with the object.

## Implementation

#### Encapsulation is often achieved by using private and protected access modifiers. Attributes and methods can be marked as private (using a double underscore \__) or protected (using a single underscore _), limiting direct access from outside the class.
