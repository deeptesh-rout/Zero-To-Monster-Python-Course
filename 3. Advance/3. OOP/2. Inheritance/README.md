# Inheritance?

## Definition

#### Inheritance is the concept of allowing a new class (called the derived class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called the base class or superclass). It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes where a subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of its superclass.

## Purpose

#### The primary purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse, organization, and the creation of a class hierarchy. It allows the derived (children) class to inherit attributes and methods from the base (parent) class.

## Implementation

#### Inheritance is implemented by specifying the base (parent) class in the definition of the derived (children) class. The derived class inherits attributes and methods from the base class and can provide its own implementations or extend the functionality. The super() function is often used to call methods from the base class. Inheritance facilitates the construction of software systems with a modular and extensible structure, where common functionality is defined in the base class, and specialized features are added in the derived classes.
