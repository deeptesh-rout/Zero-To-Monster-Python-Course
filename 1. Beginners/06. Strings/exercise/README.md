## Challenge 1: Working with Quotes and Multiline Strings

**Write a program that uses double quotes to store a famous quote.**

**Then, write a program that uses triple quotes (either ''' or """) to create a multiline poem or paragraph. Print both the quote and the poem/paragraph.**

## Challenge 2: Concatenation Fun

**Write a program that creates two variables: first_name and last_name. Concatenate them with a space in between to form a full name and print it.**

**Then, try a more elaborate concatenation: create a greeting message by combining a string literal with the full name variable.**

## Challenge 3: String Length Exploration

**Write a program that prompts the user to enter their name and then prints the length of the entered name using the len() function.**

## Challenge 4: Indexing and Slicing Adventures

**Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then prints the first and last characters of the word using indexing (e.g., word[0] for first character).**

**Next, modify the program to extract a substring using slicing. Prompt the user for the starting and ending indices (consider using int() to convert input to integers) and print the extracted substring.**

## Challenge 5: Case Conversions

**Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. Convert the sentence to uppercase and lowercase using the upper() and lower() methods, and print both versions.**

## Challenge 6: Stripping Away Whitespace

**Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence with potential leading or trailing spaces. Use the strip() method to remove these spaces and print the trimmed sentence.**

## Challenge 7: String Formatting Magic

**Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, and city. Then, use f-strings (formatted string literals) to create a formatted message that introduces the user with their details.**
