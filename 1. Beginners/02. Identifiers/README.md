# Identifier

#### Identifier is a name given to entities like variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. It helps to uniquely identify these entities in the program.

## Rules Of Identifier

#### 1. It must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (\_)

#### 2. The remaining characters can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9)

#### 3. Python is case-sensitive, so variable and Variable are different identifiers.

#### 4. Reserved keywords are not allowed.

## Conventions for Naming Identifiers

#### 1. Use descriptive names to make the code more readable.

#### 2. Avoid using names that are too short or too cryptic.

#### 3. Use underscores to separate words in a multi-word identifier (snake_case). For example, my_variable

#### 4. For constants, use all capital letters with underscores separating words (UPPER_CASE). For example, MAX_SIZE.
