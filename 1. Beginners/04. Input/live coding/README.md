# Input Function

#### input() function is used to take input from the user during the execution of a program. The input() function reads a line of text from the user as a "string" and returns that "string". It allows the user to provide input interactively.

```py
# Getting input from the user
user_input = input("Enter something: ") # returns "string"
print("You entered:", user_input)
```

```py
# Get user input as an integer
user_number = int(input("How old are you: "))

# Perform some operation with the input
result = user_number * 2
print("Twice the entered number:", result)
```
