# Logical Operators

### Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. These operators allow you to combine or modify boolean values and make more complex decisions in your code.

## Logical AND (and)

#### The and operator returns True if both conditions on its left and right are True. Otherwise, it returns False.

```py
x = True
y = False
result = x and y  # Result is False
```

## Logical OR (or)

#### The or operator returns True if at least one of the conditions on its left or right is True. If both conditions are False, it returns False.

```py
x = True
y = False
result = x or y  # Result is True
```

## Logical NOT (not)

#### The not operator negates the boolean value. If the condition is True, it returns False. If the condition is False, it returns True.

```py
x = True
result = not x  # Result is False
```
