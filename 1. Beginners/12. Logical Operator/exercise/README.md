**Challenge 1: Scholarship Eligibility**

- Write a program that prompts the user for their age and grade (as a number).
- Use `and` to check if they are at least 18 years old (`age >= 18`) and have a passing grade (e.g., `grade >= 60`).
- Print messages based on eligibility:
  - If both conditions are met: "Eligible for scholarship!"
  - Otherwise, specify which condition(s) they need to meet (e.g., "Not old enough" or "Grade not high enough").

**Challenge 2: Discount with Membership or Coupon**

- Write a program that simulates a discount scenario.
- Use `or` to check if the customer has a membership (`has_membership = True`) or a valid coupon (`has_coupon = "valid"`).
- Apply a discount (e.g., 10%) to the original price if either condition is met.
- Print the final price with or without the discount.

**Challenge 3: Weekday Check with Negation**

- Write a program that prompts the user to enter a day of the week (e.g., "Monday").
- Use `not` to check if it's not the weekend (weekend days are "Saturday" or "Sunday").
- Print messages based on the day:
  - If it's not the weekend: "It's a weekday!"
  - Otherwise: "It's the weekend!"

**Challenge 4: Login with Combined Conditions**

- Write a program that prompts the user for a username and password.
- Use a combination of `and` and `not` to check:
  - Username is correct (`correct_username = "user123"`)
  - Password is not empty (`password != ""`)
- Print messages based on login attempt:
  - If both conditions are met: "Login successful!"
  - Otherwise, specify the issue (e.g., "Incorrect username" or "Empty password").
