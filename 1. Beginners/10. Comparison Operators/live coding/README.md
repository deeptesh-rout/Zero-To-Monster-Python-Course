# Comparison Operators

### Comparison operators are used to compare two values, expressions, or variables. These operators return a boolean value (True or False) based on the comparison result.

### Equality (==)

##### Checks if the values on both sides are equal.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a == b)  # Result is False
```

### Inequality (!=)

##### Checks if the values on both sides are not equal.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a != b)  # Result is True
```

### Greater Than (>)

##### Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a > b)  # Result is False
```

### Less Than (<)

##### Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a < b)  # Result is True
```

### Greater Than or Equal To (>=)

##### Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.

```py
a = 5
b = 5
result = (a >= b)  # Result is True
```

### Less Than or Equal To (<=)

##### Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a <= b)  # Result is True
```
