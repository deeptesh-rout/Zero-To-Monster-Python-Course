# Equality Operators

### Equality operators are used to compare two values for equality. They help determine whether the values on both sides are equal or not, and they return a boolean result (True or False).

## Equality (==)

#### Checks if the values on both sides are equal.

```py
a = 5
b = 5
result = (a == b)  # True
```

## Inequality (!=)

#### Checks if the values on both sides are not equal.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a != b)  # True
```
