# Numbers

## Python provides various ways to work with numbers, including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

# Basic Arithmetic Operations

```py
# Addition
sum_result = 5 + 3
print(sum_result)  # 8

# Subtraction
difference = 7 - 4
print(difference)  # 3

# Multiplication
product = 2 * 6
print(product)     # 12

# Division
quotient = 10 / 2
print(quotient)    # 5.0 (even if the result is a whole number, division returns a float)
```

# Exponentiation

```py
# Exponentiation
power_result = 2 ** 3
print(power_result)  # 8
```

# Working with Floats

```py
# Floating-point numbers
float_num = 3.14

# Rounding
rounded_num = round(float_num, 2)
print(rounded_num)  # 3.14

# Conversion from int to float
int_to_float = float(5)
print(int_to_float)  # 5.0
```
