# Assignment Operators

## Assignment (=)

#### The basic assignment operator assigns the value on the right side to the variable on the left side.

```py
    x = 10  # Assigns the value 10 to the variable x
```

## Addition Assignment (+=)

#### Adds the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
    x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
```

## Subtraction Assignment (-=)

#### Subtracts the value on the right from the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
y = 20
y -= 3  # Equivalent to y = y - 3
```

## Multiplication Assignment (\*=)

#### Multiplies the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
z = 5
z *= 2  # Equivalent to z = z * 2
```

## Division Assignment (/=)

#### Divides the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
a = 8
a /= 4  # Equivalent to a = a / 4
```

## Floor Division Assignment (//=):

#### Performs floor division on the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
b = 17
b //= 3  # Equivalent to b = b // 3
```

## Exponentiation Assignment (\*\*=)

#### Performs floor division on the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
c = 2
c **= 3  # Equivalent to c = c ** 3
```

## Modulus Assignment (%=)

#### Computes the modulus of the current value of the variable on the left divided by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```py
d = 10
d %= 3  # Equivalent to d = d % 3
```
