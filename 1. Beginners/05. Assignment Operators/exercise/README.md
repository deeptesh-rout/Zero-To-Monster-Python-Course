## Challenge 1: Shorthand Updates

**Objective:** Utilize shorthand assignment operators to modify a variable's value.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize a variable named `count` with a value of 5.
2. **Add 3:** Update `count` by adding 3 using the `+=` operator. Print the new value.
3. **Subtract 2:** Update `count` by subtracting 2 using the `-=` operator. Print the new value.
4. **Multiply by 4:** Update `count` by multiplying it by 4 using the `*=` operator. Print the new value.
5. **Divide by 2:** Update `count` by dividing it by 2 using the `/=` operator. Print the new value.

## Challenge 2: Increment and Decrement

**Objective:** Explore the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize two variables: `x` with a value of 10 and `y` with a value of 20.
2. **Increment x:** Increase `x` by 5 using the `x += 5` operator (equivalent to `x = x + 5`). Print the updated value of `x`.
3. **Decrement y:** Decrease `y` by 3 using the `y -= 3` operator (equivalent to `y = y - 3`). Print the updated value of `y`.

## Challenge 3: Combining Operations

**Objective:** Perform calculations and update variables in a single line using combined assignment operators.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize a variable named `total` with a value of 100.
2. Set the cost of two items: `item1 = 25` and `item2 = 30`.
3. **Update total:** Subtract the combined cost of both items from `total` in a single line using the `-=` operator: `total -= item1 + item2`. Print the remaining balance in `total`.

## Challenge 4: Augmented Assignment with Strings

**Objective:** Modify strings using the `+=` operator for concatenation.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize a variable named `message` with the value "Hello".
2. **Concatenate string:** Append " World!" to the end of `message` using the `+=` operator: `message += " World!"`. Print the final message.
