**Tuples in Python**

This document explores working with tuples in Python. We'll cover creating tuples, accessing elements, immutability, and unpacking.

**Challenge 1: Creating Tuples**

- **Using parentheses ():** Create a tuple containing your favorite foods.
- **Using the tuple() function:** Create a tuple from a list (e.g., `tuple(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])`).

**Challenge 2: Accessing Tuple Elements**

- Create a tuple containing different data types (string, number, boolean).
- Access elements using their index (just like with lists).

**Challenge 3: Immutability of Tuples**

- Try to modify an element in a tuple using indexing and assignment (e.g., `my_tuple[0] = "new value"`).
- Observe the error message that you'll get since tuples are immutable (unchangeable).

**Challenge 4: Unpacking Tuples**

- Create a tuple with student information (name, age, grade).
- Use tuple unpacking to assign these values to separate variables.
