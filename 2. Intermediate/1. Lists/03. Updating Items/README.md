# Updating Items

#### Lists in Python are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements.

#### If you want to update any item in list, First you'll have to select the item using [index] and then change the value inside that.

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Update the item at index 2
my_list[2] = 10

print(my_list)
```
