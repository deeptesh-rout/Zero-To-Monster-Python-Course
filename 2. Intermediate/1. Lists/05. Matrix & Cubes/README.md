# 2D List

#### A list is a versatile data structure that can store multiple elements. Lists can be one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), or even higher-dimensional.

## 1D List

#### A one-dimensional list is a simple list that contains elements in a linear sequence.

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## 2D List

#### A two-dimensional list is essentially a list of lists. Each element in the outer list is itself a list.

```py
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

## 3D List

#### A three-dimensional list is a list of lists of lists. It can be thought of as a cube of elements, where each element is a list.

```py
cube = [
    [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ],
    [
        [10, 11, 12],
        [13, 14, 15],
        [16, 17, 18]
    ],
    [
        [19, 20, 21],
        [22, 23, 24],
        [25, 26, 27]
    ]
]
```
