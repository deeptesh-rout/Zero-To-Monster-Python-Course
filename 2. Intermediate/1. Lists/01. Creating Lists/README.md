# Lists?

### A list is a data structure that can store a collection of items. It is one of the built-in data types and is commonly used to hold an ordered sequence of elements. Lists can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.

## Key features of lists

#### ðŸ‘‰ Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted, allowing you to access elements by their index.

#### ðŸ‘‰ You can modify the contents of a list by adding or removing elements.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Lists can grow or shrink in size as needed. You can add or remove elements without specifying the size beforehand.

## Creating Lists

```py
# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]

# Creating a mixed-type list
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

# Accessing elements of a list
print(numbers[0])   # 1
print(fruits[2])    # banana
print(mixed_list[1])  # hello
```
