**Challenge 1: Creating Sets**

- **Using curly braces {}:** Create a set of your favorite hobbies.
- **Using the set() function:** Create a set from a list containing duplicate elements (e.g., `set([1, 1, 2, 3])` will remove duplicates).

**Challenge 2: Set Membership and Checking for Uniqueness**

- Create a set of numbers.
- Check if a specific number is present in the set using the `in` operator.
- Try adding a duplicate element to the set and observe that it's not included (sets cannot have duplicates).

**Challenge 3: Set Operations: Union, Intersection, Difference**

- Create two sets: one representing movies you've watched and another representing your friend's watched movies.
- Use the following set operations to find:
  - **Union:** The movies watched by either you or your friend.
  - **Intersection:** The movies you both have watched.
  - **Difference:** The movies you've watched that your friend hasn't and vice versa (use appropriate methods like `union()`, `intersection()`, and `difference()`).

**Challenge 4: Adding and Removing Elements from Sets**

- Create a set of fruits.
- Add a new fruit to the set using the `add()` method.
- Remove a specific fruit from the set using the `remove()` method.
- (Optional) Try removing an element that's not in the set using `discard()` (which won't cause an error).
