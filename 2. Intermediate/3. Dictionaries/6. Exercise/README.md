**Challenge 1: Creating Dictionaries**

- **Using curly braces {}:** Create a dictionary to store phone numbers for friends (key: name, value: phone number).
- **Using the dict() function:** Create a dictionary from a list of key-value pairs (e.g., `dict([("apple", "fruit"), ("ball", "toy")])`).

**Challenge 2: Accessing Dictionary Values by Key**

- Create a dictionary to store movie information (title, director, year).
- Access specific values using their keys (e.g., print the title and director of a movie).

**Challenge 3: Adding and Updating Key-Value Pairs**

- Create a dictionary to store student grades (name: grade).
- Add a new student and their grade to the dictionary.
- Update an existing student's grade in the dictionary.

**Challenge 4: Removing Key-Value Pairs**

- Create a dictionary to store shopping cart items (item: quantity).
- Remove an item from the cart using the `del` keyword.

**Challenge 5: Checking for Keys and Avoiding Errors**

- Write a program that checks if a specific key exists in a dictionary before accessing its value.
- Use the `in` operator and `get()` method to handle potential `KeyError` exceptions if the key is not found.

**Challenge 6: Iterating Over Dictionaries**

- Create a dictionary to store employee information (name: department).
- Iterate through the dictionary using a for loop to print both the names and departments.
- Try iterating over keys, values, and key-value pairs separately using different methods (e.g., `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`).

**Challenge 7: Nested Dictionaries**

- Create a dictionary to store customer information (key: customer ID, value: another dictionary with details like name, address, phone number).
- Access nested elements using appropriate indexing with keys.
